//A class to do physics math
//For nathan seeeeebeeee to do do :)

//make functions that accept two velocities, masses, and:
//-return velocity for a perfectly elastic collision
//-return velocity a perfectly inelastic collision
//-return velocity for an elastic collision that disappates a percentage of energy
//-given a certain amount of force from these situtations, return the time (impulse equation)
//-and given a certain amount of time, return the force
//etc, do research
